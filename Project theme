Decoding emotions through sentiment analysis of social media conversations.


 Definition:

          This project is about analyzing emotions (happy, sad, angry, neutral, etc.) expressed by people in social media posts, comments, tweets, reviews, or messages using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP).

It tries to understand how people feel about a product, service, movie, political issue, or any trending topic.

Steps Involved:

Data Collection
Data Preprocessing
Sentiment Categories
Model Training
Sentiment Analysis
  
Data Collection

            Collect social media data (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube comments, Reddit, etc.) using APIs or web scraping.

Data Preprocessing

           Remove noise (hashtags, links, emojis).
Tokenization (breaking sentences into words).
Stopword removal (“is”, “the”, “and”).
Stemming/Lemmatization (reducing words to root form).

Sentiment Categories

             Positive (happy, satisfied)
Negative (sad, angry, disappointed)
Neutral (normal, no emotion)
Advanced: Joy, Fear, Anger, Surprise, Trust, etc.

Model Training

            Use machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, SVM).
Or deep learning models (LSTM, BERT, RoBERTa for NLP).

Sentiment Analysis

            Predict the emotion score of each text.
Example: “This phone is awesome!” → Positive
“I hate the slow delivery” → Negative
Visualization
Use graphs, word clouds, dashboards to show overall public emotions.

Applications

Business → Brands know customer opinions on products.
Politics → Measure public reaction to leaders or policies.
Movies/Events → Audience reaction analysis.
Customer Service → Detect unhappy customers early.
